- Add validation option that:
	- verifies dimensions in source match actual 
	- checks for unused images 
	- checks that images exist
	- look at ppvimage for ideas

- Instead of assuming css used based on name .ig* .ic* .. parse HTML for actual styles used

- Generate report on what was done
	- table of illustrations procesed in the form id|fileName|width|caption(line breaks converted to <br/>)

- Fix bug where newline is added to end of file with -w option (possibly other situations as well)

- Fix issue with -w option that occurs when multiple instances of the same image occur within source (only last instance gets updated)

- Check for unused files in /images

- BuildImageDictionary needs to handle nonimage files in images/ folder (like ignore subdirectories). Implement isFileImageFile()

- Refactor strings to use .format

- Standardize if, while statements and other similar to use () or not.. fncall( x ) to fncall(x)

- buildImageDictionary should take image path as argument

- Add support for linked images (check option.. others areas?)

- Add id to JSON so non-standard filename/ids can be used

- Update max sizes for check routine with values used by PG for .epub .mobi generation:
	epub
	MAX_IMAGE_SIZE  = 127 * 1024  # in bytes
	MAX_IMAGE_DIMEN = (800, 1280)  # in pixels
	MAX_COVER_DIMEN = (800, 1280)  # in pixels

	mobi
	MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_KINDLE  = 127 * 1024  # in bytes
	MAX_IMAGE_DIMEN_KINDLE = (1200, 1920)  # Kindle Fire HD 8.9" in pixels
	MAX_COVER_DIMEN_KINDLE = (1200, 1920)  #

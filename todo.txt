- Add validation option that:
	- verifies dimensions in source match actual 
	- checks for unused images 
	- checks that images exist
	- look at ppvimage for ideas

- ^ is redundant for re.match?

- Instead of assuming css used based on name .ig* .ic* .. parse HTML for actual styles used

- Generate report on what was done
	- table of illustrations procesed in the form id|fileName|width|caption(line breaks converted to <br/>)

- Fix bug where newline is added to end of file with -w option (possibly other situations as well)

- Fix issue with -w option that occurs when multiple instances of the same image occur within source (only last instance gets updated)

- Check for unused files in /images

- Need a way for --calcimagewidths to handle images in source file that are not part of .il statements (like <img>).. if manual addition is the chosen method to handle this rewrite calcimagewidths to preserve these manual additions on rewrites.

- BuildImageDictionary needs to handle nonimage files in images/ folder (like ignore subdirectories). Implement isFileImageFile()

- Standardize if statements and other similar to use () or not..

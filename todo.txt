- Add new option that takes a ppgen source file and converts all .il tags into equivilent HTML. This would be used in special cases when .il/.ca tags or macros are insufficient and raw HTML must be used. The generated code would be a base to work off of that is functionally equivalant to the original .il/.ca statements. 

psuedocode:
# create temporary ppgen source file that contains only .il/.ca lines 
# run ppgen on temporary source file 
# parse CSS (related to illustrations/captions) and illustration related HTML from output
# using parsed css, add .de statements to output
# replace existing .il/.ca statements with 
#	 .if t
#	 original .il/.ca statements
#	 .if-
#	 .if h
#	 parsed HTML
#	 .if-

- Handle *[Illustration or flag it for manual resolution

- Add validation option that:
	- verifies dimensions in source match actual 
	- checks for unused images 
	- checks that images exist
	- look at ppvimage for ideas
